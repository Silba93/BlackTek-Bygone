The Original CodeBase that this project was built on top of (The Forgottenserver 1.4.2) used the GNU-GPL license, which can be found inside the "original codebase" folder, please be aware of this, as it is why this project currently falls under duo licensing.

All code changes and contributions to this project fall under MIT license. You can find this specific license included in the directory with this readme.
