## What is BlackTek Server?
__________________
**BlackTek Server** is an open source **2D Top Down MMORPG Game Server**, with tailor-made gameplay and tile based movement,  developed in modern C++. 

## What is the point of BlackTek Server?
_______________
**BlackTek Server** is intended to provide a user-friendly experience building 2D MMORPG's in a _**rapid development environment**_. Ultimately the goal is to create a user experience that removes the barrier between _**content creator**_ and _**programmer**_. 

## What sparked this idea?
__________________

BlackTek Server's origins started first with [OpenTibia](https://github.com/opentibia/server) and later [The Forgottenserver](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) , both are game servers designed to emulate a popular 2D MMORPG known as Tibia. <br>
<br> Having had my fun growing up tinkering with OpenTibia servers like TFS, I always wished they were not built so strict (explicitly emulating tibia), and allowed much more custom types of things. Since that never happened, I decided to do it myself! <br> 
<br> BlackTek Server's starting codebase is [The Forgottenserver 1.4.2](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/releases/tag/v1.4.2), and BlackTek Server [1.0]() and [1.1]() were built to be almost completely backwards compatible with TFS 1.4.2.
